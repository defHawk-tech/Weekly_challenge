# 🔐 The Hacker's Cipher Challenge

Think you've got what it takes to **crack a real hacker-style encoding method**? 🤔  
This challenge uses **multiple obfuscation techniques** inspired by real-world cryptography and malware evasion tactics.

## 🕵️‍♂️ The Challenge:
Your mission is simple: **decode the hidden message** below.

### 🔑 **Encoded Message:**
```
M5f/k7u+r5O7vuOX/5O7Kw==
```
### 🛠 **How Was It Encoded?**
This message wasn't just scrambled—it was **transformed using multiple cryptographic techniques**. Some of the methods used include:  
✔ **Character Substitution** – Certain letters were swapped with others.  
✔ **Bitwise Manipulation** – Data was altered at the binary level.  
✔ **XOR Encryption** – A key was used to mask the content.  
✔ **Base64 Encoding** – The final result was made to look harmless.  

## 💡 **Hints:**
- Think like a **reverse engineer** or **malware analyst**. 🔍  
- XOR encryption is **reversible**—what gets encoded can be decoded!  
- Base64 is just a mask... what's underneath?  

## 🚀 **How to Participate**
1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/defHawk-tech/Weekly_challenge.git
   cd hackercipherchallenge
   ```
2. Analyze the encoded message.  
3. Write a script or use manual techniques to **recover the original message**.  
4. Drop your answer in a GitHub Issue or Tweet it with `#HackerCipherChallenge`.  

Are you ready? **Let’s see who cracks it first!** 🏆
